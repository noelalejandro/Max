#### [NGEcho.amxd](https://github.com/noelalejandro/Max/blob/main/NGEcho/NGEcho.amxd) is a Feedback Delay Network (FDN) Echo Machine & Reverberator, designed and programmed for use in Ableton Live Suite. Drawing upon the legacy of digital signal processing pioneers Manfred Schroeder, Ben Logan, John Stautner, and Miller Puckette, NGEcho.amxd is capable of simulating warbly tape echoes or lush reverbs with infinite decay. Users have control over:
- Input/Output gain
- Pre-Delay
- Delay Time in two modes: Free(ms) & Sync(bpm)
- Feedback
- Blend which smoothens out transients
- Lo Cut/Hi Cut/Q of a State Variable Filter on the device's output
- Dry/Wet mix amount

#### In its current form, NGEcho.amxd is strictly for use in Ableton Live Suite though, in later iterations, I intend to implement the device as a VST3 & AU component. As a proof of concept, I have created them as VST3 & AU using Max's RNBO Audio Plugin Export functionality. A basic plugin is created using the JUCE framework but the GUI leaves much to be desired. My intention is to develop the programming skills required to improve upon this user interactivity and interface. 

## Install NGEcho.amxd
